# California House Price Prediction üöÄ

This project is a web application that predicts house prices in California using a linear regression model. The model is trained on the **California Housing** dataset and deployed using a Flask web framework.


> **Why this project?**  
> It demonstrates the end‚Äëto‚Äëend workflow of a machine‚Äëlearning project‚Äîdata exploration, feature engineering, model training, serialization, and deployment‚Äîwrapped in an approachable UI.

## üìå Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Predict prices** | Input `median_income`, `house_age`, `total_rooms`, `population` ‚Üí output predicted median house value. |
| **User‚Äëfriendly UI** | Clean Flask front‚Äëend that accepts inputs and displays results instantly. |
| **Jupyter notebook** | `Linear Regression ML Implementation.ipynb` contains a full walkthrough of the data pipeline and model training. |
| **Model artifacts** | The trained `LinearRegression` instance and the corresponding `StandardScaler` are shipped as `regmodel.pkl` and `scaling.pkl`. |

## Model Development

The machine learning model is a simple linear regression model trained on the California Housing dataset. The entire process of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training is documented in the `Linear Regression ML Implementation.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

The trained model and the scaler are saved as `regmodel.pkl` and `scaling.pkl` respectively.
